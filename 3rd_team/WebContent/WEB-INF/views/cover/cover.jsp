			typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
			dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
			galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
			survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
			typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
			the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
			passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
			Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it?
			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
			readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
			using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
			of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making
			it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
			web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and
			a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
			infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
			accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
